# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

We are an experienced team of CS education researchers and practitioners with the skills and prior experience to accomplish the goals of the proposal. All PIs will contribute to data collection, analysis, and interventions in their own classrooms.

PIs Stephens-Martinez, Velasco, and Battestilli are in the 2nd cohort of the Cultural Competence in Computing [(3C) Fellow program](https://identity.cs.duke.edu/fellows.html) (2021-2023). 3C Fellows learn social science topics, such as identity, intersectionality, racism, bias, and discrimination, and how these topics impact computing environments. The goal of the program is to leverage these 3C topics to foster more inclusive and equitable cultures in computing, which will directly impact the goals of this project.

Our team also includes two PhD students, Shao-Heng Ko and Micheal Zhan, who are integral to our research efforts.
