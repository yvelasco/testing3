Shao-Heng Ko is a PhD candidate and course instructor in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University, advised by Kristin Stephens-Martinez. His research interests broadly encompass Computing and Computer Science Education Research (CER/CSEd). Instead of focusing solely on the art of teaching computing or computer science, Shao-Heng views CER/CSEd as a study of how to enhance the learning environment for students in these fields. His current research aims to characterize computing students' help-seeking behaviors, approaches, and tendencies, with a focus on the use of multiple help resources across various instructional contexts.

Before focusing on CER/CSEd, Shao-Heng's research spanned a range of theoretical and empirical topics under the umbrella of algorithms for real-world applications, including e-commerce, pricing, social networks, and redistricting and gerrymandering. 

Prior to his studies at Duke, Shao-Heng worked at Academia Sinica. He holds a BS and MS from National Taiwan University. He hails from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, a tropical harbor city with a rich history that includes periods under Japanese and Dutch rule.
