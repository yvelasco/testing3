## All Publications by Research Team

These works represent the broader research contributions from our team that have laid the foundation for this project and continue to inform our approach to investigating student help-seeking behaviors:

{% comment %} Grab grant-specific publications and all citations {% endcomment %}
{% assign grant_citations = site.data.grant_citations.grant %}
{% assign all_citations = site.data.citations %}
{% comment %} The variable below will be modified later. {% endcomment %}
{% assign non_grant_citations = all_citations %}

{% comment %}
The loop below is roughly equivalent to:
non_grant_citations = [item for item in all_citations if item["id"].strip() not in grant_citations]
Liquid doesnâ€™t mutate in place, so we build a filtered copy instead.
{% endcomment %}

{% for doi in grant_citations %}
  {% assign trimmed_doi = doi | strip %}
  {% assign non_grant_citations = non_grant_citations | reject: "id", trimmed_doi %}
{% endfor %}
